        <h3>JavaScript Basics</h3>
        <p>JavaScript is used for building websites.</p>
        <p>To build a website you need 3 technologies:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>HTML (creates the content of a website).</li>
            <li>CSS (CSS changes the appearance of the website).</li>
            <li>JavaScript (JavaScript make the webstie interactive).</li>
        </ol>
  
       <p>JavaScript essentially gives instuctions to a computer and the computer follows the instructions.</p>
         
       <br> 
       <h4>Setup</h4>
       <p>First install a web browser (Like Google Chrome). Google Chrome is the recommended browser.</p> 
       <a href="https://supersimple.dev/js-basics/">Then go to: https://supersimple.dev/js-basics/</a>
       <p>Once at this website go to a blank area of the webpage and right click, then choose inspect.</p>
       <p>Once the code appears at the bottom Select the Console tab.</p>
       <p>If the Console doesn't show up you can click on the three dots at the bottom right and 
        choose the Dock to bottom icon (the grey box will have the white area in the top center).</p>
       <p>In the Console type:</p>  <p>alert('hello');</p>
       <img src="alerthello.png" alt="Example code"> 

        <p>The Code must look exactly like above to work.</p>
        <p>When you press Enter it will display a message saying Supersimple.dev says hello.</p>
        <p>Changing the hello in the alert(''); will allow you to display other messages.</p>
        <p>Although supersimple.dev is the website being used you can do this on any website.</p>

        <br>
        <h4>Terminology</h4>
        <ul>
        <p>Code</p>
        <li>Instuctions given to the computer</li>
        <p>Running the code</p>
        <li>When we trigger the code to run (such as pressing enter in the Console)</li>
        <p>Programming lanuages</p>
        <li>Use to write code.</li>
        <li>There are many differnety programming languages.</li>
        <p>Programming language examples:</p>
        <li>JavaScript</li>
        <li>Python</li>
        <li>Java</li>
        <p>JavaScript Code</p>
        <li>We are using JavaScript so the code we wrote was JavaScript code.</li>
        <p>Modifying the Webpage</p>
        <li>When you use JavaScript code to change something on the current webpage.</li>
        <p>Syntax</p>
        <li>Rule you have to follow when using a programming language (like JavaScript).</li>
        </ul>

        <br>
        <h4>Math</h4>
       
     

        <br>
        <h4>JavaScript Basics Continued</h4>
        <p>You can do math in the Console</p>
        <p>In the Console type 2 + 2</p>
        <p>Under the code we just typed will appear the number 4.</p>
        <p>When you press Enter the code will run and 4 will be calculated.</p>
        <p>In addition to addition you can also use other kinds of arithmetic like subtraction.</p>
        <p>Try typing 5 - 3 in the Console and pressing enter.</p>
        <p>You will get the answer of 2.</p>
        <p>You can also make temporary changes to an already existing webpage.</p>
        <p>type in to the Console:</p>
        <p>document.body.innerHTML = 'hello';</p>
        <p>This will remove the current information on the page and replace it with whatever is
            in between the ' ' (in this case hello).</p>
        <p>This is an example of modifying the webpage.</p>
        <p>Syntax rules must be followed when programming otherwise the computer won't understand your code.</p>

        <h3>Numbers and Math</h3>
        <p>For this section go to:</p>
        <a href="https://supersimple.dev/projects/amazon/">Visit: https://supersimple.dev/js-basics/</a>
        <p>This website is an ecommerce website where you can buy products and looks similar to Amazon.</p>
        <p>I did not make this website but following along you will learn to build a website like this.</p>
        <p>After finding this website click on the shopping cart icon (See below image).</p>
        <img src="supersimple_devCart.png" alt="Example image of the ecommerce shopping cart"> 
        <p>Once inside the shopping cart notice the order Summary and how all items in the cart are added up
         and the tax is added to get the Order total.</p>
        <p>This will be the section we will be working on in this section.</p>
        <p>We will first open the Console by right clicking on a blank area of the webpage and click inspect.</p>
        <p>Next click the Console tab.</p>
        <p>We previously learned about adding and substracting using JavaScript using the Console.
            You can also multiply using the asterisk * (star shaped) key.</p>
        <p>2 * 4 for instance will give you 8.</p>
        <p>You can also Divide using a forward slash / character.</p>
        <p>8 / 4 for instance will give you 2.</p>
        <p>Math in JavaScript is very similar to how math is normally written.</p>
        <p>You can also do multiple numbers like 2 + 2 + 2 to equal 6</p>
        <p>JavaScript can also work with decimal numbers.</p>
        <p>2.5 * 2 would equal 5 for instance.</p>
        <p>Now check in the cart on the supersimple.dev website</p>
        <p>The cart should have 2 packages of socks (6 Pairs) and 1 Intermediate Size Basketball.</p>
        <p>If these items are missing try reloading the website using the information from above.</p>
        <p>You can also re-add these products to the cart if needed.</p>
        <img src="CartDetails.png" alt="Image shows what your cart should look like."> 
        <p>First lets calculate the cost of the products before shipping and taxes are added in.</p>
        <p>In the cart this number will be the $42.75 in the Order Summary section next to the Items (3):</p>
        <p>To calculate this value in JavaScript we simply need to add together the cost of the products.</p>
        <p>Lets first start with the cost of the socks.</p>
        <p>The socks cost 10.90</p>
        <p>There are 2 packages of socks though so it would be:</p>
        <p>10.90 * 2 for the socks.</p>
        <p>We still need to add the cost of the Basketball which is 20.95.</p>
        <p>So the socks and the Basketball would look like:</p>
        <p>10.90 * 2 + 20.95 In the Console.</p>
        <p>Press Enter and you should get 42.75</p>
        <p>This is the same number as the amount in the Order Summary section of the Cart at the top of the page.</p>
        <p>Now we will add in the shipping cost.</p>
        <p>In the Order Summary you will notice the Shipping & handling: with $4.99 next to it.</p>
        <p>We will be adding this 4.99 to our 42.75 in the Console</p>
        <p>First type out the 10.90 * 2 + 20.95 again but do not press enter.</p>
        <p>Then enter a plus sign + and the 4.99 for shipping.</p>
        <p>You should now have:</p>
        <p>10.90 * 2 +20.95 + 4.99 in your Console.</p>
        <p>Now press Enter and you should get 47.74</p>
        <p>This number matches the Total before tax: section amount in the Order Summary.</p>
        <p>Before we Continue we need to focus on a concept called the Order of Operations.</p>
        <p>Adding, Subtracting, Mutliplying, and Dividing are Operations.</p>
        <p>+, -, *, and / are called Operators.</p>
        <p>Typically multiplication and division are done first (* , /), addition and subtraction are done after this (+, -).</p>
        <p>This is known as the order of operation. JavaScript also follows the order of operations.</p>
        <p>In JavaScript the order of operations is also known as operator precedence.</p>
        <p>Multiply and divide have the same priority (meaning one is not done automatically before the other).</p>
        <p>Add and subtract also have the same priority.</p>
        <p>If two operators have the same priority it will calculate from left to right.</p>
        <p>You can use brackets to change what portion of the calcuation is done first.</p>
        <p>Brackets have the highest priority and come before multiplication and division.</p>
        <p>Try typing out 2 + 3 * 5 and press Enter.</p>
        <p>You should get 17 since the 3 * 5 will calculate first then add the 2.</p>
        <p>Now try (2 + 3) * 5 and press Enter.</p>
        <p>You will notice that the 2 + 3 in the brackets added first this time before it was multiplied
            making the answer 25 this time.</p>
        <ol>
        <p>Order of Operations</p>
        <li>( )</li>
        <li>* /</li>
        <li>+ -</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Brackets start with an opening bracket and close with a closing bracket.</p>
        <p>The calcuation goes in between the opening and closing brackets.</p>
        <br>
        <p>For the next part remove all the items in the shopping cart.</p>
        <p>Next go to the home page by clicking the top left amazon symbol.</p>
        <p>Now add one Basketball by clicking the Add to Cart under the product.</p>
        <p>Then change the number of Adult Plain Cotton T-Shirt - 2 Pack to 2 using the drop-down menu
            and add them to the cart.</p>
        <p>Go back to the cart (click on the cart in the top right (should show a 3 in it)).</p>
        <p>Right click and choose Inspect.</p>
        <p>The right side of the checkout should show the cost of the three new items in the Order Summary.</p>
        <p>The "Items (3):" line should show a new amount of $36.93</p>
        <p>To calculate this amount using JavaScript code first go to the Console tab (Right Click and choose Inspect if
            you haven't yet).</p>
        <p>First type in the cost of the Basketball which is 20.95</p>
        <p>Then type the plus mark + and the cost of the T-shirts 7.99</p>
        <p>Since there are two T-Shirt Packs you need to multiply by two * 2</p>
        <p>You should now have:</p>
        <p>20.95 + 7.99 * 2</p>
        <p>When you press Enter it will calculate the total which is 36.93 Which is the same as the "Items (3):" line.</p>
        <p>Notice that the multiplication happened before the addition because of the order of operations.</p>
        <p>Next we will want to figure out how to calculate the "Estimated tax (10%):" line.</p>
        <p>To calculate percentages we need to understand how percentages work.</p>
        <p>Percentages are based on how much of 100 something would represent.</p>
        <p>1% for instance is 1 out of 100 or 1 divided by 100 (1/100)</p>
        <p>So 10% is 10/100</p>
        <p>10% or 10/100 is equal to 0.1</p>
        <p>So to calculate 10% we just need to multiply the answer we have in the Console by 0.1</p>
        <p>Type in the Console:</p>
        <p>36.93 * 0.1</p>
        <p>Now press Enter and you will get 3.693</p>
        <p>You will notice that this number is similar to the amount calculated in the "Estimated tax (10%):" line.</p>
        <p>The number we calculated has a 3 at the end but because that is less then even one cent the three is dropped From
            the "Estimated tax (10%):" line.</p>
        <p>The cost in the "Estimated tax (10%):" line has been rounded down and that is something that we will go over later
            in this lesson.</p>
        <p>If you wanted to do the calcuation for the individual items and then multiply it by 0.1 you might get the 
            incorrect tax amount without following the order of operations.</p>
        <p>Remember that multiply comes before addition.</p>
        <p>Therefore if you did:</p>
        <p>20.95 + 7.99 * 2 * 0.1</p>
        <p>You would get the wrong amount. The addition in this case needs to be done prior to multiplying by 0.1.</p>
        <p>To fix this you will want to include brackets since brackets come before multiplication and division in
            the order of operations.</p>
        <p>You should instead write it this way:</p>
        <p>(20.95 + 7.99 * 2) * 0.1</p>
        <p>This would give you the correct tax amount.</p>
        <br>
        <p>In Math numbers that aren't fractions or don't contain decimals are called whole numbers.</p>
        <p>1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,... are examples of whole numbers.</p>
        <p>In programming however, we call whole numbers integers.</p>
        <p>In programming numbers with decimals are called floating point numbers (or floats).</p>
        <p>1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 3.4, ... are examples of folating point numbers.</p>
        <p>Computers have a problem working with floats (floating point numbers).</p>
        <p>You can see this problem if you type in the Console 0.1 + 0.2</p>
        <p>Instead of giving you 0.3 which would be the expected answer it gives a 0.3 followed by many zeros then a four.</p>
        <p>Although this is very close to 0.3 it is slightly off.</p>
        <p>This issue is common in other programming languages as well.</p>
        <p>This problem is a result of the way computers store numbers.</p>
        <p>Computers can only store zeros and ones.</p>
        <p>For integers the computer can use many zeros and ones to store the number.</p>
        <p>10 can be stored as 1010 for instance.</p>
        <p>For decimal numbers or floats the computer can't store the number properly.</p>
        <p>When the computer tries to store 0.2 in binary the number will be similar to 0.2 but will result in something
            like:</p>
        <p>0.1999969482421875</p>
        <p>The computer tries to store a number close to 0.2 but the number it stores will never reach 0.2 and will be
            a tiny amount less then 0.2</p>
        <p>There are some floats that the computer can store without any issues.</p>
        <p>0.25 for instance can be stored accurately without any issue.</p>
        <p>When calculating money we want to avoid any inaccuracies.</p>
        <p>Now go into the Cart.</p>
        <p>Make sure the cart has 1 Basketball with free shipping and one Adults Plain Cotton T-shirt 2 Pack
             (Quantity: should be 1).</p>
        <p>To change the number of t-shirts click Update and change the Quantity to 1 then click save.</p>
        <p>The T-shirt should also have free shipping selected.</p>
        <p>Now we will calculate the number at the top next to Items (2):</p>
        <p>In the console add the cost of the Basketball to the T-shirt package:</p>
        <p>20.95 + 7.99</p>
        <p>When you press Enter, Because of the floating numbers (the decimals) the value will be inaccurate.</p>
        <p>To avoid these issues the best practice is to calculate in cents instead of dollars.</p>
        <p>So instead of 20.95 we will calculate 2090 since that is how many cents 20 dollars and 90 cents is.</p>
        <p>You will aslo need to turn the end value from cents back into dollars though so the total will 
            need to be divided by 100.</p>
        <p>Remember we will want the addition to occur first so first we surround the addition of 2095 and 799 with
            brackets.</p>
        <p>So the new calcuation should be:</p>
        <p>(2095 + 799) / 100</p>
        <p>If you type this into the console and press Enter you should get the same number as the Items (2): 
            section of the Order Summary.</p>
        <ul>   
        <p>Important lessons:</p> 
        <li>Calcuations with folats are sometimes inaccurate.</li>
        <li>When working with money it is best practice to calculate in cents and divide the total by 100 to get back dollars.</li>
    </ul>
