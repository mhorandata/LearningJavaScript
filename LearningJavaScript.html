        <h3>JavaScript Basics</h3>
        <p>JavaScript is used for building websites.</p>
        <p>To build a website you need 3 technologies:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>HTML (creates the content of a website).</li>
            <li>CSS (CSS changes the appearance of the website).</li>
            <li>JavaScript (JavaScript make the webstie interactive).</li>
        </ol>
  
       <p>JavaScript essentially gives instuctions to a computer and the computer follows the instructions.</p>
         
       <br> 
       <h4>Setup</h4>
       <p>First install a web browser (Like Google Chrome). Google Chrome is the recommended browser.</p> 
       <a href="https://supersimple.dev/js-basics/">Then go to: https://supersimple.dev/js-basics/</a>
       <p>Once at this website go to a blank area of the webpage and right click, then choose inspect.</p>
       <p>Once the code appears at the bottom Select the Console tab.</p>
       <p>If the Console doesn't show up you can click on the three dots at the bottom right and 
        choose the Dock to bottom icon (the grey box will have the white area in the top center).</p>
       <p>In the Console type:</p>  <p>alert('hello');</p>
       <img src="alerthello.png" alt="Example code"> 

        <p>The Code must look exactly like above to work.</p>
        <p>When you press Enter it will display a message saying Supersimple.dev says hello.</p>
        <p>Changing the hello in the alert(''); will allow you to display other messages.</p>
        <p>Although supersimple.dev is the website being used you can do this on any website.</p>

        <br>
        <h4>Terminology</h4>
        <ul>
        <p>Code</p>
        <li>Instuctions given to the computer</li>
        <p>Running the code</p>
        <li>When we trigger the code to run (such as pressing enter in the Console)</li>
        <p>Programming lanuages</p>
        <li>Use to write code.</li>
        <li>There are many differnety programming languages.</li>
        <p>Programming language examples:</p>
        <li>JavaScript</li>
        <li>Python</li>
        <li>Java</li>
        <p>JavaScript Code</p>
        <li>We are using JavaScript so the code we wrote was JavaScript code.</li>
        <p>Modifying the Webpage</p>
        <li>When you use JavaScript code to change something on the current webpage.</li>
        <p>Syntax</p>
        <li>Rule you have to follow when using a programming language (like JavaScript).</li>
        </ul>

        <br>
        <h4>Math</h4>
       
     

        <br>
        <h4>JavaScript Basics Continued</h4>
        <p>You can do math in the Console</p>
        <p>In the Console type 2 + 2</p>
        <p>Under the code we just typed will appear the number 4.</p>
        <p>When you press Enter the code will run and 4 will be calculated.</p>
        <p>In addition to addition you can also use other kinds of arithmetic like subtraction.</p>
        <p>Try typing 5 - 3 in the Console and pressing enter.</p>
        <p>You will get the answer of 2.</p>
        <p>You can also make temporary changes to an already existing webpage.</p>
        <p>type in to the Console:</p>
        <p>document.body.innerHTML = 'hello';</p>
        <p>This will remove the current information on the page and replace it with whatever is
            in between the ' ' (in this case hello).</p>
        <p>This is an example of modifying the webpage.</p>
        <p>Syntax rules must be followed when programming otherwise the computer won't understand your code.</p>

        <h3>Numbers and Math</h3>
        <p>For this section go to:</p>
        <a href="https://supersimple.dev/projects/amazon/">Visit: https://supersimple.dev/js-basics/</a>
        <p>This website is an ecommerce website where you can buy products and looks similar to Amazon.</p>
        <p>I did not make this website but following along you will learn to build a website like this.</p>
        <p>After finding this website click on the shopping cart icon (See below image).</p>
        <img src="supersimple_devCart.png" alt="Example image of the ecommerce shopping cart"> 
        <p>Once inside the shopping cart notice the order Summary and how all items in the cart are added up
         and the tax is added to get the Order total.</p>
        <p>This will be the section we will be working on in this section.</p>
        <p>We will first open the Console by right clicking on a blank area of the webpage and click inspect.</p>
        <p>Next click the Console tab.</p>
        <p>We previously learned about adding and substracting using JavaScript using the Console.
            You can also multiply using the asterisk * (star shaped) key.</p>
        <p>2 * 4 for instance will give you 8.</p>
        <p>You can also Divide using a forward slash / character.</p>
        <p>8 / 4 for instance will give you 2.</p>
