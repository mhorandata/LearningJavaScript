        <h3>JavaScript Basics</h3>
        <p>JavaScript is used for building websites.</p>
        <p>To build a website you need 3 technologies:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>HTML (creates the content of a website).</li>
            <li>CSS (CSS changes the appearance of the website).</li>
            <li>JavaScript (JavaScript make the webstie interactive).</li>
        </ol>
  
       <p>JavaScript essentially gives instuctions to a computer and the computer follows the instructions.</p>
         
       <br> 
       <h4>Setup</h4>
       <p>First install a web browser (Like Google Chrome). Google Chrome is the recommended browser.</p> 
       <a href="https://supersimple.dev/js-basics/">Then go to: https://supersimple.dev/js-basics/</a>
       <p>Once at this website go to a blank area of the webpage and right click, then choose inspect.</p>
       <p>Once the code appears at the bottom Select the Console tab.</p>
       <p>If the Console doesn't show up you can click on the three dots at the bottom right and 
        choose the Dock to bottom icon (the grey box will have the white area in the top center).</p>
       <p>In the Console type:</p>  <p>alert('hello');</p>
       <img src="alerthello.png" alt="Example code"> 

        <p>The Code must look exactly like above to work.</p>
        <p>When you press Enter it will display a message saying Supersimple.dev says hello.</p>
        <p>Changing the hello in the alert(''); will allow you to display other messages.</p>
        <p>Although supersimple.dev is the website being used you can do this on any website.</p>

        <br>
        <h4>Terminology</h4>
        <ul>
        <p>Code</p>
        <li>Instuctions given to the computer</li>
        <p>Running the code</p>
        <li>When we trigger the code to run (such as pressing enter in the Console)</li>
        <p>Programming lanuages</p>
        <li>Use to write code.</li>
        <li>There are many differnety programming languages.</li>
        <p>Programming language examples:</p>
        <li>JavaScript</li>
        <li>Python</li>
        <li>Java</li>
        <p>JavaScript Code</p>
        <li>We are using JavaScript so the code we wrote was JavaScript code.</li>
        <p>Modifying the Webpage</p>
        <li>When you use JavaScript code to change something on the current webpage.</li>
        <p>Syntax</p>
        <li>Rule you have to follow when using a programming language (like JavaScript).</li>
        </ul>

        <br>
        <h4>Math</h4>
       
     

        <br>
        <h4>JavaScript Basics Continued</h4>
        <p>You can do math in the Console</p>
        <p>In the Console type 2 + 2</p>
        <p>Under the code we just typed will appear the number 4.</p>
        <p>When you press Enter the code will run and 4 will be calculated.</p>
        <p>In addition to addition you can also use other kinds of arithmetic like subtraction.</p>
        <p>Try typing 5 - 3 in the Console and pressing enter.</p>
        <p>You will get the answer of 2.</p>
        <p>You can also make temporary changes to an already existing webpage.</p>
        <p>type in to the Console:</p>
        <p>document.body.innerHTML = 'hello';</p>
        <p>This will remove the current information on the page and replace it with whatever is
            in between the ' ' (in this case hello).</p>
        <p>This is an example of modifying the webpage.</p>
        <p>Syntax rules must be followed when programming otherwise the computer won't understand your code.</p>

        <h3>Numbers and Math</h3>
        <p>For this section go to:</p>
        <a href="https://supersimple.dev/projects/amazon/">Visit: https://supersimple.dev/js-basics/</a>
        <p>This website is an ecommerce website where you can buy products and looks similar to Amazon.</p>
        <p>I did not make this website but following along you will learn to build a website like this.</p>
        <p>After finding this website click on the shopping cart icon (See below image).</p>
        <img src="supersimple_devCart.png" alt="Example image of the ecommerce shopping cart"> 
        <p>Once inside the shopping cart notice the order Summary and how all items in the cart are added up
         and the tax is added to get the Order total.</p>
        <p>This will be the section we will be working on in this section.</p>
        <p>We will first open the Console by right clicking on a blank area of the webpage and click inspect.</p>
        <p>Next click the Console tab.</p>
        <p>We previously learned about adding and substracting using JavaScript using the Console.
            You can also multiply using the asterisk * (star shaped) key.</p>
        <p>2 * 4 for instance will give you 8.</p>
        <p>You can also Divide using a forward slash / character.</p>
        <p>8 / 4 for instance will give you 2.</p>
        <p>Math in JavaScript is very similar to how math is normally written.</p>
        <p>You can also do multiple numbers like 2 + 2 + 2 to equal 6</p>
        <p>JavaScript can also work with decimal numbers.</p>
        <p>2.5 * 2 would equal 5 for instance.</p>
        <p>Now check in the cart on the supersimple.dev website</p>
        <p>The cart should have 2 packages of socks (6 Pairs) and 1 Intermediate Size Basketball.</p>
        <p>If these items are missing try reloading the website using the information from above.</p>
        <p>You can also re-add these products to the cart if needed.</p>
        <img src="CartDetails.png" alt="Image shows what your cart should look like."> 
        <p>First lets calculate the cost of the products before shipping and taxes are added in.</p>
        <p>In the cart this number will be the $42.75 in the Order Summary section next to the Items (3):</p>
        <p>To calculate this value in JavaScript we simply need to add together the cost of the products.</p>
        <p>Lets first start with the cost of the socks.</p>
        <p>The socks cost 10.90</p>
        <p>There are 2 packages of socks though so it would be:</p>
        <p>10.90 * 2 for the socks.</p>
        <p>We still need to add the cost of the Basketball which is 20.95.</p>
        <p>So the socks and the Basketball would look like:</p>
        <p>10.90 * 2 + 20.95 In the Console.</p>
        <p>Press Enter and you should get 42.75</p>
        <p>This is the same number as the amount in the Order Summary section of the Cart at the top of the page.</p>
        <p>Now we will add in the shipping cost.</p>
        <p>In the Order Summary you will notice the Shipping & handling: with $4.99 next to it.</p>
        <p>We will be adding this 4.99 to our 42.75 in the Console</p>
        <p>First type out the 10.90 * 2 + 20.95 again but do not press enter.</p>
        <p>Then enter a plus sign + and the 4.99 for shipping.</p>
        <p>You should now have:</p>
        <p>10.90 * 2 +20.95 + 4.99 in your Console.</p>
        <p>Now press Enter and you should get 47.74</p>
        <p>This number matches the Total before tax: section amount in the Order Summary.</p>
        <p>Before we Continue we need to focus on a concept called the Order of Operations.</p>
        <p>Adding, Subtracting, Mutliplying, and Dividing are Operations.</p>
        <p>+, -, *, and / are called Operators.</p>
        <p>Typically multiplication and division are done first (* , /), addition and subtraction are done after this (+, -).</p>
        <p>This is known as the order of operation. JavaScript also follows the order of operations.</p>
        <p>In JavaScript the order of operations is also known as operator precedence.</p>
        <p>Multiply and divide have the same priority (meaning one is not done automatically before the other).</p>
        <p>Add and subtract also have the same priority.</p>
        <p>If two operators have the same priority it will calculate from left to right.</p>
        <p>You can use brackets to change what portion of the calcuation is done first.</p>
        <p>Brackets have the highest priority and come before multiplication and division.</p>
        <p>Try typing out 2 + 3 * 5 and press Enter.</p>
        <p>You should get 17 since the 3 * 5 will calculate first then add the 2.</p>
        <p>Now try (2 + 3) * 5 and press Enter.</p>
        <p>You will notice that the 2 + 3 in the brackets added first this time before it was multiplied
            making the answer 25 this time.</p>
        <ol>
        <p>Order of Operations</p>
        <li>( )</li>
        <li>* /</li>
        <li>+ -</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Brackets start with an opening bracket and close with a closing bracket.</p>
        <p>The calcuation goes in between the opening and closing brackets.</p>
        <br>
        <p>For the next part remove all the items in the shopping cart.</p>
        <p>Next go to the home page by clicking the top left amazon symbol.</p>
        <p>Now add one Basketball by clicking the Add to Cart under the product.</p>
        <p>Then change the number of Adult Plain Cotton T-Shirt - 2 Pack to 2 using the drop-down menu
            and add them to the cart.</p>
        <p>Go back to the cart (click on the cart in the top right (should show a 3 in it)).</p>
        <p></p>
